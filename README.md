# Example Electron Expansion Box

![3D Render of Example Expansion Box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Knelfy/Example-Electron-Expansion-Box/main/Render%20(final).jpg)

Free to use/modify example Acorn Electron expansion box in Fusion360 and STEP formats (based on Acorn Plus 1 reference images)

Note, as yet, the model is untested and has had no tolerances added. I can't promise it is accurate and in fact it probably isn't.

The model, as it stands, crudely houses/protects an ElkSD128 but could be easily modified to work for other things.

ToDo List:

- Add tolerances
- Test/Adjust dimensions
- Test/Adjust clips
- Split bottom cover to separate body for ease of printing
- Add feet
- Taper sides flush with Electron
- Add textured appearance to center area
- Any other ideas/suggestions

The preview image shows roughly what it might look like if printed. Note the position of the ElkSD128 has been corrected in the actual model,
